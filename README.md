# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering

# Project Overview -:

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix’s TV shows and movies as of 2019, based on data collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. The analysis aims to uncover key insights about content availability, genre distribution, and regional differences. A key focus is testing the hypothesis that Netflix has shifted its content strategy to emphasize TV shows more than movies in recent years. This exploration also includes clustering of content based on text features to identify similar titles.

# Dataset Description -:

The dataset includes metadata for TV shows and movies available on Netflix, with details such as title, release year, country availability, genre, and runtime. External ratings from sources like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes can be integrated to enrich the analysis.

# Key Questions Addressed -:
  1. What is the distribution of movies versus TV shows on Netflix, and how has this evolved over time?

  2. How does content type and availability differ across countries?

  3. Which genres dominate Netflix’s library, and what trends exist in genre popularity?

  4. What is the ratio of Movies to TV Shows on Netflix, and how has this evolved over recent years?

  5. How does the availability of content vary across different countries or regions?

  6. Is there evidence that Netflix has shifted focus from movies to TV shows in its content strategy?

  7. How does the release year distribution look, i.e., how recent is the content on the platform?

  8. What are the typical runtimes for movies and TV shows, and do they vary by genre?

  9. Using text-based features, can content be clustered into meaningful groups representing similar themes or styles?

  10. How do ratings from external sources (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes) correlate with content type, country, or genre?

How has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced content availability and themes (if applicable)**



# Tools and Technologies -:

Python libraries: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

Streamlit for building an interactive app, integrated with Gemini API for enhanced natural language interaction and presentation.

# Usage-:

The project includes scripts for loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data. Visualizations include time series trends, distributions of genres, and clustering results to highlight content similarity.

# Insights and Impact -:
This analysis provides actionable business insights into Netflix’s content strategy, helping stakeholders understand evolving audience preferences and guiding content acquisition decisions.

# Future Work

Future enhancements could include deeper sentiment analysis of title descriptions, user engagement metrics integration, and expanded external rating sources for a more comprehensive evaluation.
